##### General Comments 

Gatbsy is a front-end framework built on React and powered by GraphQL. It builds your site as "static" files which can easily be deployed. It uses powerful preconfiguration to build websites with extremely fast page loads.

Regarding data, the platform's rich data plugin ecosystem allows you to build sites with the data you want, from a variety of sources including CMSs, SaaS services, APIs, databases, your own file system, and more directly into your pages using GraphQL.

###### Pros
1. Extremely fast page loading - Gatsby offers built-in code splitting and cache handling mechanisms. They are generally 2-3 times faster than similar types of sites. Gatsby follows Google's PRPL (Push, Render, Pre-cache, Lazy-load) architectural pattern which aims to boost your website's performance, specifically on mobile devices. 
2. You can collect data from wherever it may currently live - Markdown, JSON, your favorite CMS, third party APIs, etc. Graph QL lets you query all necessary data. 
3. Great documentation! 
4. Access to dozens of "starters" - boilerplate repos that provide a solid starting off point. 
5. A great point of entry to learn React and Graph QL due to its excellent documentation. 
6. Inexpensive hosting - Github pages or AWS
7. It is built off of React so if you know that language, this framework is easy to get used to. 

###### Cons
1. Gatsby "develop" VS Gatsby "build" - There is a big difference between the two. Just because you can run something locally with gatsby develop, doesn't mean it will build without errors. 
2. The build time increases dramatically when adding lots of styling or other libraries. 

### Ratings & Reviews

##### Documentation 
[The documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) for Gatsby is great. We were able to get up and running in less than an hour by following the directions online. 

I also appreciate how the "get started" page offers 4 levels of assistance for people with varying skill sets. It seems accessible to beginners and those who are extremely advanced. 

##### Systems Requirements 
To get up and running with Gatsby, you will need to have a recent version of Node.js installed on your computer. It can work with AWS and Heroku quite easily. There is documentation for both processes.  

#### Ramp-Up Projects
I think it would take a junior developer with a background in React a full work day to get familiar with the program. Obviously there is a lot to explore. We did not work with Graph QL at all so I am sure that would take longer to learn that query language. 

#### Community Support and Adoption Levels 
The following websites use Gatbsy: 
1. Reactjs.org
2. Codesandbox.io
